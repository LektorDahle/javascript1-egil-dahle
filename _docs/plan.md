# What I want to do in this project

Before starting this, I wanted to test out three things. Using JSDoc in a project, unit-testing/TDD all JavaScript-code and making single-page-applikation (SPA).

Before starting this I have tested all three separate from each other, and it is evident that JSDoc is going to be the easiest part of this. The reason why I say unit-testing/TDD and not just unit-testing or just TDD is that I want to do test-driven-development, but my skills are not there yet. 

A year and a half ago I made a simple SPA chat-page with login and connection to the chatgpt api. In this project I plan to reuse this SPA-code. I do not plan to make the whole rany-days webpage single-page, a store would want themselvse and their customers to be able to link spesific products, so some of the pages have to use their own urls. The payment-page is the most logical place to "inject" som spa-fun.

# What I have to do in this project
Renew my rany-days webpage - using the provided api at https://v2.api.noroff.dev/rainy-days. In this api we also see the addition of discounts on the price and the ability to favourite a product. I interprite the favourite ability like adding a clickable heart and a separate page or viewing for all the favourites.

My page will use cookies/local storage, so I have to add a page about this as well.
